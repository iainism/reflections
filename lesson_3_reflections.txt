When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To keep a back-up of work off my computer, to work between computers or to share my work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because then you can choose when to merge changes from the remote into your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Use a fork to obtain a clone of another person's repository.  Clone locally to get another working copy (e.g. to easily have a demo build while keeping a stable build).  Branches may be used to try out new development routes (e.g. major refactoring or new features).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    By having a copy of the last known state of the remote repo locally it is easier to understand differences that have occurred since the last checkout or clone of the remote repository.
